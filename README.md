# Mood Comparison of Melodies and Lyrics

In this project, I led a team of 5 students to develop classification models aimed at analyzing the mood of Thai songs, focusing on both their melodies and lyrics. Our primary goal was to predict the emotions conveyed by these components and determine whether the predicted moods were consistent with each other.

To achieve this, we utilized data processing and machine learning techniques, designing separate models for melody and lyric classification. After training and evaluating the models, we achieved an accuracy of 60% in classifying the mood of melodies and lyrics.

This project provided valuable insights into the relationship between musical elements and lyrical content, as well as practical experience in building and evaluating machine learning models for real-world applications.
